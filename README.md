# Zatoichi-Showdown
# Currently the begginings of a game I'm working on using unity. If you're interested in turning this project into a start 
# up e-mail me at freshnessninja@gmail.com and we can talk in further detail about what I have envisioned for this project.
#
# otherwise, feel free to download and play this. you will probably need a copy of unity to do so.

# GOAL
# there are 5 enemies on the map, represented as blue, yellow, or red cubes. kill them all and you will attain the victory
# screen, fail and you will see a game over screen

# CONTROLS
# wasd to move
# left click to throw a shuriken
# space to jump
# right click to throw a grapple line
# while on the grapple line you may use w and s to ascend and descend the rope
# pressing space while on the grapple line will result in you flinging yourself off wildly

# other info:
# enemies are not visible if they are not in your field of view, same is true of you
# some enemies may be above you, beware
# current bug where shurikens will occasionally multi hit, beware
# current bug where occasionally while running fast you will clip through ground, beware.
# current bug where health bar is not the most accuratly represented, beware.
